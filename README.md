Mini game created using only HTML and CSS. The game featured a group of bunnies that moved up and down the screen, and the goal of the game was to click on them as they moved in order to earn points.

To create this game, I began by designing the layout and styling of the page using HTML and CSS. I then used CSS animations to create the movement of the bunnies, animating their position up and down the screen in a smooth and fluid manner. I also added clickable areas to each bunny using HTML and CSS, which allowed users to click on them in order to earn points.
